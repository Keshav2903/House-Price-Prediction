# House-Price-Prediction
A machine learning model using Python to predict house prices based on features such as location, area, 
number of rooms, and amenities. 
Performed basic data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis to identify important predictors 
influencing housing prices. 
Applied algorithms including Linear Regression and Decision Trees to build and validate the predictive model. 
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess accuracy 
and reliability.
